# Algorithms Part 1 (Princeton) Submissions

[Introduction to Algorithms](https://coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), created by Princeton University.

This course covers algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and performance analysis of Java implementations. 

Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

This repo contains my work in progress for Part 1 of the course - Part 2 coming soon.
